# graph-data

# About The Project
Mini project of graphing data from various input files with additional features.
Script generates 2 plots. One with histograms, second with data.
To the second graph, legend, mean values (with plots), max and min values of each dataset, some labels and 2 prediction values are added.
Names for the legend are copied from the filenames.
**Note:** For now, only y values are possible to graph. In the future, it will be possible to add measured x values to the plot.


# Built With
Python 3.8.0

# Getting started
### Requirements
##### packages:
- matplotlib (pip install matplotlib)

All required packages in requirements.txt file.

### Working with graph-data:
1. Copy files, that you want to graph, to the directory with a script.
2. Run the script.
3. Specify extension of files to graph (just json for now).
4. After successful execution, 2 plots should be visible: 1 with histograms and 1 with actual data.

# Usage
I personally use it mostly for fun, to see how measurements evolve over time and to have a quick prediction of the next possible value.

Script project contains also sample json files for processing.
